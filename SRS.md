## Overall Description

### 2.1 Product perspective

This system aims to minimize the interaction between actors by controlling orders by the application for mobile devices. It is expected that this system will be used by restaurant customers, and employees as cooks and waiters at the moment.

Note: To ensure an efficient management of the system, the restaurant must be willing to fully use this system with its customers, allow full control of orders by this means and provide an open WIFI network for the restaurant costumers.

### 2.2 Product functions

For the clients it's necessary that in their application they capture the QR code found in the table assigned by the waiter to start ordering mainly. The application registers the clients and shows them the menu of the restaurant ordered by categories. When selecting each dish, it can be included in a section of notes to give specifications of the dish or drink, and they will be added in the form of a list to confirm the order later.

Optionally, customers can see information and comments about the restaurant, request the presence of staff and pay through the application.

The waiters have control of the tables assigned to the clients, having visualization of the available tables and the requests of each one of them. They also visualize each dish ready to go and the table that corresponds to it.

The cooks receive each list generated at the moment, when finishing the dish they mark the list as finished so that the waiter continues to pick up the dishes.
